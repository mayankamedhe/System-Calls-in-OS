  PID STAT
26880 Z+

S means Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
Z means Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent
Since

Initially, it is in S state which gets interruped on giving the input.
Later, the child has a variable in its table which is allocated some memory. It has to give this value to the parent process.
This makes it a zombie process. 
Also there is a long delay in the parent process hence the it takes time for the zombie process to get cleaned up. As a zombie process cleans up when the parent process exits.
